          **BEFORE** opening an issue, please read and follow these steps:

          1. Are you using HomeAssistant?
          If yes, please open your issue at https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues
          UNLESS a developer told you to come here.

          2. Is your issue related to a device not working as expected?
          If yes, please open an issue at: https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.yml

          3. Check the troubleshooting section if your problem is described there:
          https://zwave-js.github.io/zwave-js-ui/#/troubleshooting/bug_report

          4. Check the changelog if your problem was already fixed recently.
          https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
          We cannot provide support if you are not using the latest version.

          5. Make sure to provide the necessary information, as described here:
          https://zwave-js.github.io/zwave-js-ui/#/troubleshooting/bug_report

          If you are using HomeAssistant, this is how you do it:

         Home Assistant -> settings -> Integrations -> Z-Wave JS -> Configure -> Create dump -> zip the json file and post it here.
